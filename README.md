# C# Masterclass - Notes (Udemy)

## *Project Ideas to Land a Job as .NET Developer*

1. **CRM System** - Becuse Nearly every Business has some form of CRM system and I will quite likey be working on CRM systems as a .NET developer

## **Section 1**: Introduction, DataTypes And Variables

### ***History of C#***

### *C# in Enterprise Software Development and what its Used for*

- **Backend Services** - C# is widely used to build scalable and reliable backend services for enterprise applications.
- **Bussiness Applications** - From ERP to CRM Systems, C# powers a variety of Business-critical software in large organisations.
- **Data Visualization -** like WinForms and WPF enable the creation of rich, interactive data visualization tools.
- **Rapid Prototyping** - The C# toolset allows enterprise developers to quickly build and iterate on new software ideas.

### *C# in Game Development*

- **Unity** - Unity is a popular game engine that uses C# as its primary programming language.
- **Unreal Engine** - While Unreal Engine primarily uses C++, it also supports C# through the .NET integration.
- **MonoGame** - MonoGame is an open-source framework that allows developers to build 2D and 3D games in C#.
- **Godot Engine** - Godot is a free open-source game engine that provides first-class support for C#.

### *C# in Mobile App Development*

- **Xamarin** - Xamarin allows developers to build Native mobile apps for iOS, Android, and Windows using C#.
- **MAUI** - MAUI lets C# developers build native cross-platform apps for iOS, Android, and more.

### *C# in Web Development*

1. **ASP.NET** - ASP.NET is a mature web framework that allows developers to build dynamic web applications in C#. **(Very strong, Powerful and Fast web development framework.)**
2. **Blazor** - Blazor is a newer web framework that lets developers create client-side web apps using C#.
3. **SignalR** - SignalR is a C# library for adding real-time, bidirectional communication capabilities to web apps  between the user input and output really fast to update the user interface accordingly to enable the best possible web experience you can have. 
4. **Web API** - C# can be used to build RESTful APIs and microservices to power modern web applications. 

### *Why is C# so Popular Today*

- **Enterprise Adoption** - C# has become a dominant language in enterprise software development, powering many mission-critical applications.
- **Versatility** - The languageâ€™s broad capabilities allow it to be used in a wide range of domains, from games to mobile apps and a lot of companies use it..
- **Rich Ecosystem** - The .NET ecosystem provides a wealth of libraries, tools and frameworks to support C# developers, its ecosystem allows for efficient problem solving as a lot of developers use it and there is alot of resources and tools available to help developers along the way with whatever they are working on and when problems arise you are able to find solutions very quickly because someone else has probably already run into the problem before.

### ***Understanding Frameworks and Compiling***

- In .NET the **.NET Core Framework** includes components for building web apps, APIs, and other applications efficiently.
- **Compiling:** This is the process of converting human-readable code (written in languages like C#) into machine code that a computer can execute. A compiler takes the source code, checks it for errors, optimizes it, and produces an executable file. In .NET, the C# compiler translates your code into an intermediate language (IL), which is then further processed by the .NET runtime.
